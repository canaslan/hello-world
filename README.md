**## About me**

I’m Can (pronounced /t͡san/).

I am a seasoned, innovation-driven Product Designer and UX Expert with a passion for imagining and designing futures. Growing up in the 90s, I was captivated by the possibilities of communicating with extraterrestrial civilisations, exploring time travel and teleportation, and designing technologies like solar-powered firefighting drones and Hyperloop-style maglev trains. This childhood imagination has evolved into a career focused on solving complex problems and advancing humanity through thoughtful design.

Pivoting from Japanese Studies, I built a successful career in product design without mentorship or external help, demonstrating resilience and self-motivation. Since 2016, I have gained extensive experience in designing and managing products and user experiences across four countries, working in agency, startup, mid-sized, and large organisations. My proven track record includes taking ownership, challenging assumptions, and redefining business models.

In my roles, I consistently sought additional responsibility and showed initiative, often operating as a UX team of one. My adaptability is reflected in my ability to thrive in diverse countries, industries, and corporate environments.

With an MSc in IT Product Design from SDU Denmark, I combine technical expertise with a deep understanding of user-centred design principles. My goal is to create innovative solutions that drive progress and deliver exceptional user experiences, staying true to the forward-thinking creativity of my childhood self.
